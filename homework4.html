		<h2>Redwoods</h2>
		
		
			<p> Over the years I have had plenty of opportunities to travel throughout Northern
			California to discover the wonder of the Redwood forests composed of 
			<a href="http://www.savetheredwoods.org/redwoods/giant-sequoias/">Giant Sequoias</a> 
			and <a href="http://www.savetheredwoods.org/redwoods/coast-redwoods/">Coast Redwoods.</a>  

			<a href="redwoods.html"><img src="img/redwoods2.jpg" class="left" title="click for larger image of The Redwoods"

			There was the trip I took where I drove up the coast from San Francisco all the way to 
			the Oregon border visiting such wonders as Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, Humboldt Redwoods State Park, 
			and Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park.  That experience humbled me with the awe and majesty
			of these massive natural structures.  Much has been accomplished over the decades to preserve these
			groves of trees that have an average age of 2000 years.  I had the pleasure last 
			Summer of visiting on of these reserves, 
			<a href="http://www.savetheredwoods.org/park/montgomery-woods-state-natural-reserve/">The Montgomery Woodstate Natural Reserve,</a>
			where the third largest tree can be found.
			</p>
			
		<h2>Yosemite National Park</h2>
		
			<p>The first spring I moved up here I spent a week up in Yosemite National Park.
			The park opened up the door to my first experience communing with nature in the 
			Sierra Nevada mountain range.  I hiked many different trails throughout the Yosemite
			Valley taking me to various wonders such as 
			<a href="http://www.yosemitehikes.com/yosemite-valley/half-dome/gallery-trail-part-1.htm">Half dome</a>
			 and <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/yosemitefallstrail.htm">Yosemite falls.</a>
			 			 
			<a href="yosemite.html"><img src="img/yomap1.gif" class="right" title="click for Imagemap of Yosemite National Park"

			Unfortunately, I was never able to make it to the Mariposa Grove, the largest 
			grove of Giant Sequoias in the park. Two of the trees in that grove are among
			the 30 largest in the world.  The Tuolumne Meadows represent that large area in 
			the northern part of the park where elevation averages above 8,500 feet.  Within
			the meadows the infamous <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/yosemitefallstrail.htm">John Muir Trail</a>
			 and the <a href="http://www.pcta.org/">Pacific Crest Trail</a> are routed through
			the park.
