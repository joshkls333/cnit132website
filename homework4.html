    NOTES

    The function called new_window is called when the user clicks the iceberg image/link

    In the body section the corresponding code for calling the function is:

    <a href="#" onclick="new_window('motherbigbasin.html');")>

    motherbigbasin.html is passed to url, which is the name of the argument of the function

    - a value of 0 for toolbar, menubar, scrollbars, status, and fullscreen means these browser options are turned off
	- a value of 1 would mean they are turned on

	-->
	
	<script>
	
	function new_window(url)  {

			link = window.open(url,
			'_new', 'toolbar=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=0,status=0,resizable=1,top=100,left=200px,fullscreen=0,Height=700px,Width=800px', '')
		}

		<h2>Redwoods</h2>
		
		
			<p class="justify"> Over the years I have had plenty of opportunities to travel throughout Northern
			California to discover the wonder of the Redwood forests composed of 
			<a href="http://www.savetheredwoods.org/redwoods/giant-sequoias/">Giant Sequoias</a> 
			and <a href="http://www.savetheredwoods.org/redwoods/coast-redwoods/">Coast Redwoods.</a>  

			<a href="redwoods.html"><img src="img/redwoods_th.jpg" class="left" title="click for larger image of The Redwoods"
			width="175" height="93" alt="image of Redwoods"></a>

			There was the trip I took where I drove up the coast from San Francisco all the way to 
			the Oregon border visiting such wonders as Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, Humboldt Redwoods State Park, 
			and Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park.  That experience humbled me with the awe and majesty
			of these massive natural structures.  Much has been accomplished over the decades to preserve these
			groves of trees that have an average age of 2000 years.  I had the pleasure last 
			Summer of visiting one of these reserves, 
			<a href="http://www.savetheredwoods.org/park/montgomery-woods-state-natural-reserve/">The Montgomery Woods State Natural Reserve.</a>
			One of the groves within the Reserve contains the infamous Mendocino tree, which at one time was 
			considered the third largest tree in the world.

		<h2>Yosemite National Park</h2>
		
			<p class="justify">The first spring after I moved to California I spent a week up in Yosemite National Park.
			The park opened up the door to my first experience communing with nature in the 
			Sierra Nevada mountain range.  
			 			 
			<a href="yosemite.html"><img src="img/yomap_th.gif" class="right" title="click for Imagemap of Yosemite National Park"
			width="100" height="127" alt="image of Yosemite National Park"></a>
			
			I hiked many different trails throughout the Yosemite Valley taking me to various wonders such as 
			<a href="http://www.yosemitehikes.com/yosemite-valley/half-dome/gallery-trail-part-1.htm">Half dome</a>
			 and <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/yosemitefallstrail.htm">Yosemite falls.</a>
			The Tuolumne Meadows represent that large area in 
			the northern part of the park where elevation averages above 8,500 feet.  Within
			the meadows the infamous <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/yosemitefallstrail.htm">John Muir Trail</a>
			 and the <a href="http://www.pcta.org/">Pacific Crest Trail</a> are routed through
			the park.  Unfortunately, I was never able to make it to the Mariposa Grove, the largest 
			grove of Giant Sequoias in the park. Two of the trees in that grove are among
			the 30 largest in the world.  The oldest of those, named 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_Giant#/media/File:Grizzly_Giant_Mariposa_Grove.jpg">Grizzly Giant,</a>
			has been estimated to be between 1900 and 2400 years old.
			</p>
			
			<br>

		<h2>Big Basin Redwoods State Park</h2>

			<p class="justify">Big Basin Redwoods State Park represents the first California State park established in 1902.
			Over the years I have had the pleasure to take several camping trips there.  With over 80 miles of
			trails there were plenty of opportunities for scenic hiking.  Some of the special waterfalls of the Waddell
			Creek watershed to hike to
			include the <a href="http://www.redwoodhikes.com/BigBasin/Sempervirens.html">Sempivirens Falls</a>
			and the <a href="http://www.redwoodhikes.com/BigBasin/BerryCreek.html">Berry Creek Falls.</a>
			</p>
			
			<a href="#" onclick="new_window('motherbigbasin.html')"><img src="img/mother_big_basin_thumb.jpg" 
			class="left" title="click for popup of image" width="100" height="127" alt=""></a>

			<p class="justify">One of the great landmarks of the park goes by the name Mother of the Forest.  
			She stands 280 feet tall, but prior to a storm that snapped off the top 50 feet she was 329 feet tall.  
			The giant redwood held the mark as the tallest tree in the Bay Area and the tallest redwood 
			South of San Francisco.  However, another giant was found in the park recently along the Meteor trail
			measuring 328 feet giving it the title as the tallest.
