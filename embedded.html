<p class="pol">The politics of the 21st century</p>

<h2>Lefties and Righties</h2>


<p class="left">

Socialists are to the left of liberals.
 Most liberals are Democrats, although some have
wandered over to the Green party. Republicans are right-wingers. 
Most Republicans are 
conservative. What does conservative mean? Do they want to
conserve the environment? Do they want to conserve the 2nd amendment?
Do they want to conserve a woman's right to choose an abortion?
 Do they want to conserve a separation between church and state?

<h3>San Francisco Giants</h3>

<p class="right">

It may just be that the Giants have seen the last of Hunter Pence this season, and what a 
loss it has been. Pence is not only the offensive catalyst, but his presence both on the 
field and in the clubhouse is immense. Right now, the right fielder has been relegated to 
the dugout, and that may not change any time soon. The Giants were two games behind the 
first-place Dodgers in the National League West entering the games of Aug. 20, when Pence 
was placed on the disabled list because of a strained left oblique. 
They went into action on Wednesday night 8 1/2 games behind Los Angeles.

<h4>Terrell Davis</h4>

<p class="ital">
Davis might be the greatest postseason player at his position in the Super Bowl era. He 
rushed for at least 100 yards in seven postseason games, including Super Bowls XXXII and 
XXXIII, and the Broncos won all seven of those games. His 157 yards rushing against the 
Packers in Super Bowl XXXII earned him the game's MVP honors. His career postseason 
rushing average was 142.5 yards per game, the highest among any back with at least 
five playoff games. -- Jeff Legwold</p>

<p class="new">
The Warriors came away with their most impressive win of the season on Monday night, earning 
a 120-90 victory over the visiting San Antonio Spurs. Stephen Curry was absolutely scintillating, 
scoring a game-high 37 points before sitting out the entirety of the fourth quarter. 
Draymond Green stuffed the stat sheet with 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists, while Shaun 
Livingston, Brandon Rush and Marreese Speights all scored in double figures off the bench. With the 
victory, the Warriors improve to 41-4 on the season.

In what was deemed to be perhaps the most anticipated regular season matchup in NBA history, 
the game didnâ€™t quite follow the script most expected, as the Warriors generated an early lead, 
and rode that all the way to a blowout victory.
