<h2>Linked Style Sheet Example 1</h2>


<p class="main">

There comes a time when you must decide if you are going 
to be an auteur or a procrastinator. Anyone who
has the perspicacity to want to create web sites for a living
 should visit a shrink to determine if he is sane. On the other
 hand, maybe making a lot of money is easier if one becomes
 a janitor. Anyway, visit <a href="http://hills.ccsf.edu/~jklaus1"> 
my hills site</a>  if you don't know what else to do.
</p> 


<p id="new">Style sheets bring a wondrous new look to web pages, that allows
the designer more control over fonts and object placement. Try it! 
You'll like it!

Denard Span agreed to a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on Thursday, 
Andrew Baggarly of the San Jose Mercury News reports.

After an injury-plagued 2015 season with the Nationals that included him undergoing 
season-ending hip surgery, Span landed a multi-year contract with the Giants on Thursday. 
The expectation is for Span to immediately compete for the every day gig in center field 
for the Giants in place of the aging and oft-injured Angel Pagan. Span served as the 
Nationals' leadoff batter as well last season, compiling a .301/.365/.431 slash line with 
38 runs scored in 246 at-bats.
